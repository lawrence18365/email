## The Psychology That Drives Replies

### 1. Reciprocity (Give First)
From Robert Cialdini's research: When you give value first, people feel obligated to respond.

❌ "Can I get 15 minutes of your time?"
✅ "30,000 couples searched last quarter. Most couldn't find counselors in your area."

**Result:** 3-5x higher reply rates

### 2. Pattern Interrupt
Brains ignore patterns, notice anomalies. Your email must be DIFFERENT.

Tactics:
- Lowercase subject lines (feel personal)
- Short emails (most are too long)
- Specific details about THEM
- Humor when appropriate

### 3. Curiosity Gap (Zeigarnik Effect)
Open a loop without closing it. The brain NEEDS closure.

❌ "We help counselors get more clients"
✅ "Most counselors in {state} are missing this..." (they need to reply to find out)

### 4. Loss Aversion
People fear losing more than they desire gaining.

❌ "Get a free listing"
✅ "Closing founding member spots soon" (they might miss out)

## What's Working in 2026

### Email Length
**Under 80 words.** Period.

> "Messages between 50 and 125 words achieve reply rates of about 50%, showing that concise, focused communication resonates far better than lengthy pitches."

### Subject Lines
- Lowercase feels personal
- Under 50 characters
- Questions increase opens 10-15%
- Timeline hooks outperform problem hooks (10.01% vs 4.39%)

**Examples that work:**
- `couples searching in {state}` (timeline hook)
- `quick question about {company}`
- `re: your listing` (pattern interrupt - looks like reply)

### Follow-Up Timing
- Email 2: 3 days after Email 1
- Email 3: 4-5 days after Email 2
- Make follow-ups look like replies (30% performance lift)

### Plain Text > HTML
Plain text emails:
- Look personal
- Avoid spam filters
- Load instantly on mobile
- Feel like a real person wrote them
